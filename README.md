# -kali-i3
My changes from https://github.com/xct/kali-clean

First Update and Upgrade Kali Linux:
```
sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade -y
```
```
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
Then run the setup script:
```
./setup.sh
```
After the script is done reboot and select i3 (top right corner) on the login screen. Then open a terminal (`ctrl+return`) run `lxappearance`and select ark-dark theme and change the icons to papyrus.
